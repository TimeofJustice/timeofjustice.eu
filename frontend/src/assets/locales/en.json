Choose between **\"Higher\"**, **\"Lower\"**, or **\"Draw\"** for the next card.\n3. If your guess is correct:\n   - You earn a **fixed payout based on your initial bet**:\n      - **Higher / Lower** → +1× your initial bet\n      - **Draw** → +8× your initial bet\n   - Your winnings stack **linearly** on top of your initial bet.\n4. After each win, you can either:\n   - **Continue playing** (risking all winnings for the next guess)\n   - Or **cash out** (secure your current total winnings)\n\n---\n\n#### \uD83E\uDDEE Example:\n\n- 1 correct guess → 10 + 10 = **20**\n- 2 correct → 10 + 10 + 10 = **30**\n- 5 correct → **60**\n- If you guess \"Draw\" correctly: 10 + (8 × 10) = **90**\n\n---\n\n#### \uD83C\uDFC6 Perfect Run (52 Correct Guesses):\n\nIf you guess **all 51 cards** in a full deck correctly:\n\n- You receive your regular payout: **10 + (51 × 10) = 520**\n- PLUS a **legendary bonus**:\n   - **+100,000× your initial bet**\n   - Example: Bet of 10 → **1,000,000 bonus payout**\n\n---\n\n#### ❗ Important Notes:\n\n- A **single wrong guess** ends the game and you lose everything.\n- If you choose \"Higher\" or \"Lower\" and the next card is **equal**, it's considered **incorrect**.\n- If you choose \"Draw\" and the next card **matches** the previous one exactly → **correct**, and you win 8× your bet.\n\n---\n\n#### \uD83D\uDCA1 Tip:\n\n- Longer streaks = higher total rewards.\n- You don’t need to chase the perfect run to win big — even 10–15 correct guesses can add up!"

Initial Deal\n- Players: 2 cards face up\n- Dealer: 1 card face up, 1 card face down (the \"hole card\")\n\n### 2. Player Turn\nEach player may:\n- **Hit** – Take another card\n- **Stand** – Keep your current hand\n\n### 3. Dealer Turn\n- Dealer reveals their hole card\n- Must hit until total is **17 or higher**\n- Dealer busts if total exceeds 21\n\n### 4. Compare Hands\n- Closest to 21 wins\n- **Blackjack** (Ace + 10-value card) on the initial deal beats a regular 21\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCB0 Payouts\n- **Win:** 1:1\n- **Blackjack:** 3:2\n- **Push (tie):** Bet returned\n- **Lose:** You lose your bet\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDCDD Example\n- **Player:** A♠ + 8♣ = 19 → Stand\n- **Dealer:** 10♦ + 6♥ + 7♠ = 23 → Bust → Player wins\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Quick Tips\n- Always **stand on 17 or more**\n- Hit on 11 or less — you can’t bust\n- Consider doubling down on 10 or 11 if the dealer has a weak card (like 4, 5, or 6)\n- Splitting aces is usually a good move\n\n"
