            <p><strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below is an overview of the legal bases under the
                GDPR on
                which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national
                data
                protection regulations may apply in your country of residence or domicile. If more specific legal bases
                are
                applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing
                    of their
                    personal data for one or more specific purposes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> - The
                    processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for
                    the
                    implementation of pre-contractual measures requested by the data subject.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the
                    purposes of
                    the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests
                    are
                    overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the
                    protection of personal data.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data protection
                regulations
                of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the
                Federal
                Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG). The BDSG contains special provisions, in
                particular, on
                the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special
                categories of
                personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission as well as automated individual
                decision-making
                including profiling. Furthermore, data protection regulations of the individual federal states may
                apply.</p>
            <p><strong>Applicability of the GDPR and Swiss Data Protection Act:</strong> These data protection notices
                serve
                both to provide information in accordance with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (Schweizer DSG) and
                the
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, please note that, for the sake of broader
                geographical
                applicability and comprehensibility, the terms used in the GDPR have been replaced with Swiss terms.
                Specifically, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data" (or simply "data"), and "legitimate
                interest"
                used in the GDPR, the terms "processing" of "personal data" and "predominant interest" used in the Swiss
                DSG are
                used. However, the legal meaning of these terms is determined by the Swiss DSG within the scope of its
                applicability.</p>
            <h2 id="mOverview">Overview of Processing Activities</h2>
            <p>The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing, and

                <li>Providing our online services and user-friendliness.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
            <p>As part of our processing of personal data, it may be necessary to transmit or disclose the data to other
                entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals. The recipients of this
                data may
                include, for example, IT service providers or providers of services and content integrated into a
                website. In
                such cases, we comply with legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or
                agreements
                with the recipients of your data to protect your data.</p>
            <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European
                Union (EU)
                or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if the processing takes place as part of using third-party
                services or
                disclosing/transferring data to other individuals, entities, or companies, this is done in compliance
                with legal
                requirements.</p>
            <p>Subject to explicit consent or the contractual or legal requirement for transfer, we process or allow the
                data to
                be processed only in third countries with a recognized level of data protection or based on contractual
                obligations through EU Commission-approved standard data protection clauses.</p>
            <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files or other storage markers that store information on end devices and retrieve
                information from them. For example, they may store the login status in a user account, the contents of a
                shopping cart in an online store, or the accessed content and used functions of an online service.
                Cookies can
                also be used for various purposes, such as ensuring the functionality, security, and convenience of
                online
                services, as well as analyzing visitor traffic.</p>
            <p><strong>Consent Notice:</strong> We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. Therefore, we
                obtain prior
                consent from users, unless it is not required by law. Consent is not necessary when storing and
                retrieving
                information, including cookies, is strictly necessary to provide users with an expressly requested
                telemedia
                service (i.e., our online offering). Strictly necessary cookies typically include cookies with functions
                that
                are essential for the display and operation of the online service, load balancing, security, storage of
                user
                preferences and choices, or similar purposes related to providing the main and ancillary functions of
                the
                requested online service. The revocable consent is clearly communicated to users and includes
                information about
                the respective cookie usage.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes on the Legal Basis for Data Processing:</strong> The legal basis for processing users'
                personal
                data using cookies depends on whether we ask for user consent. If users give their consent, the legal
                basis for
                processing their data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies is based on
                our
                legitimate interests (e.g., in the economic operation of our online offering and improving its
                usability) or, if
                necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations, when the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our
                contractual obligations. We will provide further information on the purposes for which we process
                cookies as
                part of this privacy policy or within the scope of our consent and processing procedures.</p>
            <p><strong>Storage Duration:</strong> Regarding the storage duration, the following types of cookies are
                distinguished:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temporary Cookies (also known as session cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at
                    the
                    latest after a user leaves an online service and closes their device (e.g., browser or mobile
                    application).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Persistent cookies remain stored even after the device is
                    closed. For
                    example, they can store login status or display preferred content directly when the user revisits a
                    website.
                    The data collected through cookies can also be used for measuring the reach. If we do not provide
                    users with
                    explicit information about the type and duration of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent),
                    users
                    should assume that cookies are persistent and can have a storage duration of up to two years.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>General Notes on Revocation and Objection (Opt-Out):</strong> Users can revoke their given
                consent at any
                time and object to data processing in accordance with legal requirements. Users can, among other
                options,
                restrict the use of cookies in their browser settings (which may also limit the functionality of our
                online
                service). Objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared through the
                websites <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_new">https://optout.aboutads.info</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_new">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legal Bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR); Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Further Information on Processing Procedures, Methods, and Services:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Processing of cookie data based on consent:</strong> We use a cookie consent management
                    procedure
                    that allows us to obtain, manage, and revoke user consent for the use of cookies, as well as the
                    processing
                    and providers mentioned in the cookie consent management procedure. The consent declaration is
                    stored to
                    avoid the need for repeated consent requests and to demonstrate compliance with legal obligations.
                    The
                    storage can be done server-side and/or in a cookie (known as an opt-in cookie or similar
                    technologies) to
                    associate the consent with a user or their device. Unless otherwise specified by cookie management
                    service
                    providers, the following information applies: The storage duration of the consent can be up to two
                    years. In
                    this process, a pseudonymous user identifier is generated and stored along with the time of consent,
                    information about the scope of consent (e.g., categories of cookies and/or service providers), as
                    well as
                    the browser, system, and device used. <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).

            <h2 id="m104">Blogs and Publishing Media</h2>
            <p>We use blogs or similar means of online communication and publication (hereinafter referred to as
                "publishing
                media"). The data of readers is only processed to the extent necessary for the presentation and
                communication
                between authors and readers, or for security reasons, within the scope of the publishing media. For

            </ul>
            <h2 id="m136">Social Media Presence</h2>
            <p>We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context to communicate
                with
                active users on those platforms or to provide information about us.</p>
            <p>We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union, which may entail
                risks for
                users as it could make it more difficult to enforce their rights.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, user data within social networks is usually processed for market research and advertising
                purposes.
                For example, usage behavior and resulting user interests can be used to create user profiles. These user
                profiles can then be used, among other things, to display advertisements inside and outside the networks
                that
                are likely to correspond to the users' interests. Typically, cookies are stored on users' computers to
                store
                their usage behavior and interests. Data can also be stored in the user profiles independently of the
                devices
                used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to
                them).</p>
            <p>For a detailed description of the respective processing methods and the options for opting out (opt-out),
                please
                refer to the privacy policies and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.</p>
            <p>Regarding requests for information and the exercise of data subjects' rights, we would like to point out
                that
                these can be most effectively pursued with the providers. Only the providers have access to the users'
                data and
                can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. If you still need assistance, you can
                contact
