**timeofjustice.eu** began as a portfolio project to showcase my past and current work.
Since then, it has evolved into a playground for experimenting with new technologies and frameworks.
It's not about being perfect, but about having fun and learning new things.
The frontend is built with Vue.js, TypeScript, and Bootstrap.
The backend is powered by Django and a PostgreSQL database.
